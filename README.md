Cleaning, modelling and visualizing dummy data with PowerBi

Steps taken:
1. Cleaning Instore sales orders and Online sales orders files from unnecessary information and empty fields, utilising Power Query Editor and Copilot.
2. To create replationship between the tables, created third table Customer info with Customer ID (one to many).
3. Linked customer info table to online sales orders and Instore sales orders with customer ID.
4. To visualize the most important data from these tables, defined these questions:

- Which products have been most ordered online / instore?
- From which areas do most orders come from?
- Which customers order the most and how much are their orders in total?
- Has order amounts decreased / increased?
- How much time on average is there between order date and ship date = how efficient the company is processing orders?
- Which rep has sold the most
